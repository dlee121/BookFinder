# BookFinder

BookFinder is a text recognition app that allows you to get useful information about any book at the press of a button.

Simply point your camera at the book cover so that the title of the book is contained within the app's recognition window,
then press the green button to see the top four matches for the book cover. Then press the correct book's icon to open its google books web page on your default web browser.
